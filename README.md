### Copper is cool but very useless. You can't even make armor or tools out of it. Well, I fixed that! Copper Equipment is the simplest mod that adds copper armor and tools.

#### Mod required [Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl/versions) and [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config/versions)!
