### Copper is cool but very useless. You can't even make armor or tools out of it. Well, I fixed that! Copper Equipment is the simplest mod that adds copper armor and tools.

#### Mod required [Fabrci API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)!
